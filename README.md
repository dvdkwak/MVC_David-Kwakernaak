# MVC (YouCode? no name yet...) PHP-Framework
MVC Built by me :D (PHP-framework)


Hi there!

Cool you're here to check out my project!
Let me explain some stuff to get you started on your own php project...

First step is to download this project, when you have downloaded it put it in your root folder of your webserver 
(this should be a local webserver for developping)
In here extract the zip and make sure the files you extract are in your root.

Your folder structure should look something like this:

<b>/root<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/app<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/css<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/js<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/assets<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/images<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/config<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/controllers<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/lib<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/bootstrap<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/jquery<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/models<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/system<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/config<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/functions<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/js<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/syles<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/views<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;-/views<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/DOM<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;+/sass</b>
    
    
I know, I know.. there are more folders in it and there are some files in it as well, but I am lazy ;p
It is only an example to clearify the position of the framework in your webserver.

When this is all set you start your webserver and go to to the server's address.
This will open a setup-page which should be enough to help you setting up your project!

<b>note:</b>

there is no explenation yet on how to change the standard home page, I am still working to give a guide for that.
